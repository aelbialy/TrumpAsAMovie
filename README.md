Comparing Donald Trump's Approval rating to Mall Cop's movie rating or any other movie

This challenge was part of the January Hack night event in West London. 
The challenge was to pair up on a voted project and language,and seeing how much we can accomplish in 90 minutes of frantic coding, 
then present our project to everyone.

# The Challenge: 
Compare Donald Trump's Approval Rating to the ratings of the Mall Cop movie.

We were able to make a command line tool that would take in any movie (not just Mall Cop) as an input 
and compare it to Donald Trump's current approval rating.

# How? 
- Using the Open Movie DataBase's API to fetch the ratings of any movie https://www.omdbapi.com 
- The Huffington Post Pollester API to fetch the most current Approval raing for Donald Trump http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/donald-trump-favorable-rating
- Converting the results to a percentage and prenting out which of the two have the highest percentage :)

This was quite the fun light hearted challenge as we had a time restriction to make the best project. 

Thanks to @monodokimes for helping with this project :D
